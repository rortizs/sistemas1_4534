# Git commands

git commands are used to interact with the repository. Here are some of the most common commands:

## commit

commit is used to save changes to the repository. It is important to add a message to the commit to explain the changes that were made.

## brach

branch is used to create a new branch in the repository. Branches are used to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

## checkout

checkout is used to switch between branches in the repository. It can also be used to create a new branch and switch to it in one command.

## cherry-pick

cheery-pick is used to apply a commit from one branch to another branch. This can be useful when you want to apply a specific change to a different branch.

## reset

reset is used to undo changes in the repository. It can be used to unstage changes, discard changes, or reset to a specific commit.

## revert

revert is used to undo a commit in the repository. It creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the original commit.

## rebase

reveal is used to reapply commits on top of another branch. It can be used to keep the commit history clean and organized.

## merge

merge is used to combine changes from one branch into another branch. It creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches.

# Git Commits

a commit git repository is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. It contains the changes that were made to the repository since the last commit.
